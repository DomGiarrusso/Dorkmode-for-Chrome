## Description:

A Google Chrome theme for people who like it dark but don't want it black. Inspired by another theme I created for VS Code.

## Motivations

Chrome is my preferred browser to use for surfing the web. But I never was a fan of its dark theme. It wasn't ever dark enough for me. I tried out some other dark themes, but even they didn't fully get the color I was looking for. So, after making my own VS Code theme, I thought, why not create one for Chrome? I even used the same name and palette. Thus Dorkmode-for-Chrome was born.
